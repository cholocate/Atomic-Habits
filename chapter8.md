- 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive 
- **The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit forming.**
- The trend is for rewards to become more attractive by stimuli excitement. 
- Making a behavior attractive will increase the odds of its frequency. 
### Dopamine Spike 
- **The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died- Without desire, action stops.**
    - Habits are a dopamine-drive feedback loop. Behavior that is highly habit-forming like taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing media is all associated with higher levels of dopamine.
    - **Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure but also when you anticipate it.**
        - Cocaine addicts gets a surge of dopamine when they see powder.
        - Daydreaming about upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. 
    - Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, dopamine level spikes in anticipation. Whenever dopamine spikes, so does your motivation to act upon it. 
- **Your brain has far more neutral circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than liking them.**
    - The brain allocates so much space for regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. **Desire is the engine that drives behavior**
    - **Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.**
    - We should make our habits attractive because**it is the expectation of a rewarding experience** that motivates us to act in the first place.
### Temptation Bundling 
- Temptation bundling works by **linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.**
- You are more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. 
    - **1. AFTER I (CURRENT HABIT), I WILL (HABIT I NEED)**
    - **2. AFTER (HABIT I NEED), I WILL (HABIT I WANT)**
    - "More probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors" 
        - If you don't want to process overdue work emails, you'll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way. 
        - **Doing the things you need to do means you get to do the things you want to do.**
### Summary
- Supernormal stimuli is a heightened version of reality that increases our desire to take action. 
- Temptation bundling creates a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.
- **Engineering a truly irresistable habit is a hard task, but this simply strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.**
