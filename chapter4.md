## Chapter 4
- With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. 
- We can't always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have 
- You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.
- You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it.
