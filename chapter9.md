## Chapter 9 
- Habits that are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you'll find. 
- **"Those who learned to collaborate and improve prevails in the long history of human kind."**
    - Social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. 
    - Often, you follow the habits of your culture without any conscious reasoning behind it. 
    - Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in. 
- We imitate the habits of three groups: 
    - The Close
    - The Many 
    - The Powerful
    ### The Close
    - The closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. 
        - The chance of becoming obese increase by 57% if your friend is obese.
        - If one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would slim down about one third of the time
        - The higher your best friend's IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence. 
    - **Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.**
        - Your culture sets your expectation for what is "normal." **Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. Rise together."**
        - Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. Transform your personal quest into a shared one: You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. BECOMES: We are readers, musicians, athletes. 
    - Shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. 
    - **Friendship and community will embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.**
    ### The Many 
    - The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of individual.
    - There is an internal pressure to comply with the norms of your group. 
    - **Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.**
    - When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. 
    ### The Powerful 
    - We care so much about habits of highly effective people and try to copy the behavior of successful people because **we desire success ourselves.**
    - High status people enjoy approval, respect, and praise of others. If a behavior can get us there, we find it attractive. 
    - **Habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their culture.**
### Summary
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. 
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: The Close (family and friends), The Many (tribe and group), and The Powerful (idols, admired people)
- Build better habits by joining a culture (1) where your desired behavior is the normal behavior, (2) you already have something in common with the group.
- **If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.**
