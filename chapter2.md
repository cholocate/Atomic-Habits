## Chapter 2
- It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.   
- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. 
- For identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become, rather than a focus on what you want to achieve (outcome-based habits).
- "No thanks, I'm not a smoker" rather than "No thanks, I'm trying to quit" is a small difference but signals a shift in identity. 
- We set goals and determine actions to achieve these goals without considering our beliefs that drives the actions. We never shift the way we look at ourselves and don't realize that our old identity can sabotage our plans for change.
- Behaviour that is incongruent with the self will not last. It's almost impossible to permanently change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior/ mistakes.  
- The ultimate form of intrisic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. (passive motivation)
- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. 
- True behavior change is identity change. The only reason you will stick with a habit is that it becomes your identity. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.
- Think about the bigger picture- the goal is not to get an A in CS61A, the goal is to become confident enouggh to solve any creative problem with H.O.Fs, recursion, trees, generators, linked lists, schemes, etc...
- What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are- either consciously or nonconsciously. 
- When your behavior and your identity are fully alligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.
- The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.
- Over the long run, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. 
- Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. 
- Your habits are not the only actions that influence your identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones. As you repeat these actions, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. 
- We do change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, habit by habit. 
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up (you don't need a unanimous vote to win an election), so does the evidence of your new identity. 
- Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity, if a change is meaningful, it acutally is big. That's the paradox of making small improvements.
- The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. 
- Identity-based habits circulates around the idea of feedback loops- your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. 
- Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. 
- The real reaason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
