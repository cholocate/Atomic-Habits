## Chapter 7
- Addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.
- Disciplined people are better at structuring their lives a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. 
- Perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. 
- When the context changed, so did the habit: Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. 
- Bad habit are autocatalytic: The process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. 
    - You feel bad, so you eat junk food. 
    - You feel sluggish from watching TV, so you watch more TV because you don't have the energy to do something else. 
- **Cue induced wanting** is an external trigger that causes compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. 
- **You can break a habit, but you're unlikely to forget it.** Mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely- even if they go unused for quite a while. 
- Reducing exposure to the cue that causes a bad habit is one of the most practical ways to get rid of it. 
    - Leave your phone in another room for a few hours to get some work done
    - Stop browsing social media if you are feeling inferior and down 
    - Move TV out of the workplace if you are wasting too much time on it. 
- **Rather than make it obvious, make it invisible.** This is the inverse 1st Law of Behavior Change. 
- **Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away.**
- **Self-control is a short-term strategy.** You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. 
- Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, **your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.**
- **Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.**
