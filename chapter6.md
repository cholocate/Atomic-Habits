## Chapter 6
- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. 
- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. 
- Certain behaviors tend to arise again under certain environmental conditions. 
- **The most common form is change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.** 
- Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment: B = f(P,E). 
- The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it. 
- Many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice **but by the most obvious option.**
- Perception is directed by sensory nervous system. We perceive the world throuh sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we have  other ways of sensing stimuli. 
    - You notice when temperature drops before a storm.
    - You notice the pain in your gut rises during stomachache. 
- The most powerful of all human sensory abilities is vision. 
    - Vision cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior due to the fact we are more dependent on vision than any other sense.
    - **A small change in what you see lead to a big shift in what you do.**
### Design your environment for success 
- Every habit is initiated by a cue, we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. 
    - It's easy not to practice the guitar when it's tucked away. 
    - It's easy not to do your work on the laptop if it is surrounded by obstacles for distraction. 
- When cues spark a habit that are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore. 
    - If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.
    - If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house. 
- **If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.**
    - By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit. **Make the best choice the most obvious choice.**
    - Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you. 
- Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because **we rarely do it.**
- You can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. 
- **Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.**
### Contect is the cue
