## Chapter 1
- If you improve by 1% everyday for the next 365 days, you will end up being 37 times better than what you originally start with. 
- Good habits makes time your ally while bad habits makes time your enemy. Habits is a double-edged sword. 
- Learning one new idea won't make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.
- Imagine trying to achieve your results with melting an ice-cube. At 31.9 F, you won't still see any difference but suddenly at 32, the phase changes. If you haven't seen the results yet, it is probably because you are still melting ice and being impatient. 
- In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break the Plateau of Latent Potential.

- Goals are about results you want to achieve. Systems are about processes that lead to those results.  "The score takes care of itself." 
- Winners and Losers have the same goal, and achieving a goal is only a momentary change. 
- When we solve problems at the result level, we are solving them temporarily. In order to improve permanently, we need to solve problems at the system level. 
- The problem with a goals-first mentality is that we are putting our happiness offside until the next milestone, it makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. 
- True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about single accomplishments but the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. It is our commitment to the process that will determine our progress.
